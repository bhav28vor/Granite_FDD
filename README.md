## 🤖 **LangGraph Technical Deep Dive**

### **StateGraph Workflow Architecture**
The agentic pipeline implements sophisticated AI decision-making using LangGraph StateGraph:

```python
# Intelligent multi-node workflow with conditional routing
def _build_agentic_workflow(self) -> StateGraph:
    workflow = StateGraph(EnrichmentState)
    
    # Add intelligent processing nodes
    workflow.add_node("classify_entity", self._classify_entity_node)
    workflow.add_node("plan_enrichment", self._plan_enrichment_strategy)
    workflow.add_node("execute_business_enrichment", self._execute_business_enrichment)
    workflow.add_node("execute_individual_enrichment", self._execute_individual_enrichment)
    workflow.add_node("validate_and_score", self._validate_and_score_results)
    workflow.add_node("resolve_conflicts", self._resolve_data_conflicts)
    workflow.add_node("finalize_result", self._finalize_enrichment_result)
    
    # Conditional routing based on entity classification
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "plan_enrichment",
        self._route_enrichment_strategy,
        {
            "business": "execute_business_enrichment",
            "individual": "execute_individual_enrichment"
        }
